LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. 
It enables chaining together components like LLMs, prompt templates, parsers, retrievers, and tools into a coherent pipeline.

Core Concepts:
- Runnable: Any object that can take input and produce output.
- Chains: Combine multiple runnables sequentially.
- Agents: Dynamically decide which tools to use based on user input.
